# The actual shutter code

Just a simple PlatformIO project. Just make sure you hook everything up to the right ports - see the description in `src/main.cpp`. Its all run on interrupts triggered by the limit switches. There should be enough comments in the code for the remainder of the description - if not, bad luck.
